            <h2>JAVA HOUSE</h2>
            <P>Java House, commonly referred to as ‘Java’, opened its first store in 1999 at
                 Adam’s Arcade in Nairobi. With the aim of introducing gourmet coffee 
                 drinking culture in Kenya, the first outlet was a coffee shop and later 
                 the brand evolved to an American diner style restaurant to its present-day 
                 status as a 3 -day part coffee-led, casual dining concept.
                Java House is now one of the leading coffee brands in Africa and has
                 grown to have outlets in 14 cities across 3 countries in East Africa 
                 (Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda). It has also birthed two sister brands 
                 Planet Yogurt, a healthy, tasty and fun frozen yogurt store 
                 and 360 Degrees Pizza, a casual dining restaurant.</P>
